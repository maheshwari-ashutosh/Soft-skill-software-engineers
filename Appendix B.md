# Appendix B: Templates and Frameworks for Effective Senior Engineering

## Introduction

This appendix provides practical, actionable templates and frameworks referenced throughout this book. Think of these not as rigid prescriptions, but as robust starting points and mental scaffolds. As a Senior Software Engineer, your ability to adapt these tools to your specific context (team, project, company culture) is crucial. Use them to structure your thoughts, facilitate communication, streamline processes, and ultimately amplify your impact.

**How to Use These Templates:**

1.  **Understand the Purpose:** Read the brief introduction accompanying each template to grasp its intended use case and underlying principles.
2.  **Adapt, Don't Just Adopt:** Modify these templates based on the specific needs of the situation. Add, remove, or rephrase sections as necessary.
3.  **Combine and Iterate:** Feel free to combine elements from different templates or iterate on them over time as you discover what works best for you and your team.
4.  **Focus on the Outcome:** The template is a means to an end. The goal is clearer communication, better decisions, constructive feedback, and well-designed systems â€“ not just filling out a form.

## Section 2: Feedback Frameworks

Giving and receiving feedback effectively is a cornerstone of growth, collaboration, and high-performing teams. Frameworks provide structure to ensure feedback is clear, specific, actionable, and kind. (See Chapters 1, 6, 8, 10).

### Framework 1: SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact)

**Purpose:** To deliver clear, specific behavioral feedback by describing the context, the observable actions, and the consequences of those actions. Excellent for addressing specific instances or patterns.

- **S - Situation:** Describe the specific context. When and where did this occur?
  - _Example:_ "During yesterday's design review meeting for the caching layer..."
  - _Example:_ "When you were reviewing the pull request for the authentication module this morning..."
- **B - Behavior:** Describe the _observable_ behavior. What did the person specifically say or do? Avoid judgments or interpretations.
  - _Example:_ "...you interrupted Alex multiple times while they were explaining their concerns." (Observable) vs. "...you were being disrespectful." (Judgment)
  - _Example:_ "...you provided line-by-line comments suggesting alternative variable names and minor style nits, but didn't comment on the overall algorithm choice." (Observable) vs. "...your code review was nitpicky and unhelpful." (Judgment)
- **I - Impact:** Describe the actual result or impact of the behavior on you, the team, the project, or the customer.
  - _Example:_ "...the impact was that Alex seemed hesitant to share further thoughts, and we may have missed out on valuable insights."
  - _Example:_ "...the impact is that the developer might focus on minor changes without realizing there's a potential architectural issue we need to discuss, potentially delaying the project if a redesign is needed later."

**Putting it Together:**

> "Hey [Name], can I share some feedback? During yesterday's design review for the caching layer (Situation), I noticed you interrupted Alex multiple times while they were explaining their concerns (Behavior). The impact was that Alex seemed hesitant to share further thoughts, and I'm worried we might have missed out on valuable insights for the design (Impact)."

**Tips for Using SBI:**

- **Be Timely:** Deliver feedback as close to the event as possible (while still being appropriate).
- **Focus on Behavior, Not Personality:** Describe what you saw/heard, not character traits.
- **Be Specific:** Vague feedback is unhelpful.
- **Check Intent (Optional but often good):** "What was your thinking process there?" or "Was that your intention?" can open a dialogue.
- **Focus on Future:** Shift towards "In the future, could we try...?"

### Framework 2: STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result)

**Purpose:** Primarily used for structuring examples during interviews (behavioral questions), performance reviews, or when giving positive feedback highlighting specific accomplishments. It helps provide concrete evidence of skills and outcomes.

- **S - Situation:** Describe the context. What was the situation or challenge you/they faced?
  - _Example:_ "The production deployment for Project Phoenix was blocked last quarter due to unexpected integration failures with the legacy billing system."
- **T - Task:** Describe your/their specific responsibility or goal in that situation. What needed to be done?
  - _Example:_ "My task as the tech lead was to diagnose the root cause of the failures and devise a reliable deployment strategy."
- **A - Action:** Describe the specific actions _you/they_ took to address the task or challenge. Be detailed and focus on individual contributions.
  - _Example:_ "I first set up a dedicated staging environment mimicking production. Then, I systematically tested each integration point, adding detailed logging. I discovered the issue was related to unexpected timeouts under load. I worked with the Ops team to adjust configurations and implemented a circuit breaker pattern in our service. I also documented the findings and the new pre-deployment checklist."
- **R - Result:** Describe the outcome of the actions. What was achieved? Quantify results whenever possible.
  - _Example:_ "As a result, we successfully deployed Project Phoenix the following week with zero integration errors. The new checklist and monitoring prevented similar issues in subsequent releases, reducing deployment failures by 90% for that system."

**Tips for Using STAR:**

- **Be Specific and Concise:** Provide enough detail but avoid rambling.
- **Focus on "I" (or "They"):** Highlight individual actions and contributions.
- **Quantify Results:** Use numbers, percentages, or clear qualitative outcomes.
- **Practice:** Prepare STAR stories for common skills (problem-solving, leadership, collaboration, conflict resolution) before interviews or reviews.

### Framework 3: BOOST (Checklist for Quality Feedback)

**Purpose:** A checklist to evaluate the quality of feedback _before_ delivering it, ensuring it's helpful and well-received.

- **B - Balanced:** Does the feedback consider both strengths and areas for improvement (over time, if not in a single instance)? Is it fair?
- **O - Objective / Observable:** Is the feedback based on specific, observable behaviors or data, rather than assumptions, judgments, or hearsay? (Links closely to the 'Behavior' in SBI).
- **O - Objective (Goal-Oriented):** Is the feedback aligned with team or individual goals? Does it help the receiver understand how their actions relate to desired outcomes?
- **S - Specific:** Is the feedback precise enough for the receiver to understand exactly what is being referred to? Does it include concrete examples? (Avoid vague statements like "Good job" or "Be more proactive").
- **T - Timely:** Is the feedback delivered reasonably close to the event or observation? (Balancing timeliness with finding the right moment/setting).

**How to Use BOOST:** Before giving feedback, mentally review these points. If your planned feedback falls short on any of these, refine it.

### Framework 4: Radical Candor (Conceptual Framework)

**Purpose:** A conceptual model (popularized by Kim Scott) emphasizing that the most effective feedback and relationships stem from balancing **Caring Personally** with **Challenging Directly**. It helps diagnose your feedback style and aim for the ideal quadrant.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Radical Candor Framework
        direction TB
        YC[Care Personally] --- YD((High)) & YC --- YE((Low));
        XC[Challenge Directly] --- XF((Low)) & XC --- XG((High));

            Q2 -- High Challenge --> Q4(Obnoxious Aggression);
            Q3 -- Low Care --> Q4;
        end

        YF(Low Challenge) -- Defines --> Q1 & Q3;
        YG(High Challenge) -- Defines --> Q2 & Q4;
        XH(High Care) -- Defines --> Q1 & Q2;
        XI(Low Care) -- Defines --> Q3 & Q4;
    end

    style Q2 fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Q3 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Q4 fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

    classDef axis font-weight:bold
    class YC,XC axis
```

- **Radical Candor (High Care, High Challenge):** The ideal. Giving specific, honest feedback (challenging) because you genuinely care about the person's growth and success. _Example: "I'm saying this because I care about your progress: In the presentation, the technical details were great, but the summary didn't clearly connect to the business impact, which confused the VPs. Let's work on refining that connection for next time."_
- **Obnoxious Aggression (Low Care, High Challenge):** Challenging directly but without demonstrating care. Comes across as harsh, arrogant, or bullying. Feedback is often specific but lacks empathy. _Example: "That summary was terrible; obviously the VPs wouldn't get it."_
- **Ruinous Empathy (High Care, Low Challenge):** Caring about the person but failing to challenge them directly. Avoiding difficult conversations to spare feelings, ultimately hindering growth. Offering praise that isn't specific or withholding constructive criticism. _Example: "Great presentation!" (When it wasn't actually effective)._
- **Manipulative Insincerity (Low Care, Low Challenge):** Neither caring nor challenging. Giving dishonest praise or vague, non-committal feedback. Often stems from fear of conflict or a desire to be liked. _Example: "Yeah, the presentation went fine." (Followed by negative comments behind the person's back)._

**How to Use Radical Candor:**

- **Self-Assess:** Where does your feedback typically fall? Where do you tend to land under pressure?
- **Solicit Feedback:** Ask others how your feedback lands for them.
- **Aim for Radical Candor:** Consciously strive to challenge directly while showing you care personally. Use SBI/STAR to structure the "challenge" part effectively.

## Section 3: Design Document Outlines

Design documents (including RFCs - Requests for Comments) are critical artifacts for Senior Engineers. They clarify thinking, communicate technical plans, solicit feedback, and serve as a record of decisions. The level of detail varies based on the scope (High-Level vs. Detailed). (See Chapter 3: The Articulate Engineer).

### Template 1: High-Level Design (HLD) / Architecture Overview
